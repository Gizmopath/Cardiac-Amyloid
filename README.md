# Cardiac-Amyloid: AI for Detection and Segmentation of Cardiac Amyloidosis

This repository hosts the training scripts, pre-trained models, and resources for a neural network designed to detect and segment amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue from brightfield Congo Red-stained virtual slides.

## Overview

Cardiac amyloidosis is a condition marked by the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils, which can lead to significant cardiac dysfunction. This project employs state-of-the-art image analysis and deep learning techniques to improve detection and segmentation of amyloid deposits in digital pathology slides. Using fluorescence-guided annotations, our AI models deliver high accuracy for classification and segmentation tasks.

## Key Features

- **Tile Classification**:  
  A ResNet18-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification of tiles as amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative.
  
- **Segmentation**:  
  A U-Net model for precise, pixel-wise segmentation of amyloid deposits.
  
- **Explainability**:  
  Grad-CAM overlays highlight regions most influential in model predictions, enhancing interpretability.
